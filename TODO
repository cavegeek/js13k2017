Captain's Log to log what's happening and gve a bit of story to it.

Crew Members who can be assigned to rooms to make the rooms work better.

Rooms fail in interesting ways, for example the water purification room
contaminates a lot of fresh water.

Death on low oxygen, no food, etc.

Better looks.

Ambient music.

Plants produce less when there's more oxygen.

Make it take time to change a room type.

Notes:
Atm oxygen 23.5%
Lowset without increased fallibility: 19%
Lowest human survive: 10%

Atm CO2: 0.04%
Highest without effects: 0.1%
Unsurvivable 0.4%

Human uses 550L oxygen per day, releasing 550L CO2.
500 plants balances out oxygen of 1 human (each plant releases 1L ocygen per day)

A 12x12x10 room is about 50L, so we can call each room 50L of air.

So each room has 11.75L oxygen, and 0.02L CO2 normally.
